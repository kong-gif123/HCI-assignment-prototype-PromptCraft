# HCI-assignment-prototype-PromptCraft
Local-first prompt builder with real-time quality scoring and BYOK LLM generation.

Abstract

PromptCraft is a web-based single-page app (SPA) built to reduce the learning curve of prompt engineering and make results more predictable in generative AI workflows. It combines structured guidance (turning “messy ideas” into clear prompt fields) with real-time heuristic evaluation (instant quality scores and suggestions).
With the Google Gemini API, PromptCraft can turn natural language input into a structured prompt. It also includes a simulated quantum-inspired selection algorithm to explore multiple prompt variants and pick a higher-quality version. The project follows a local-first approach to support privacy and fast interaction.
